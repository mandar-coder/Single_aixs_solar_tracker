# Single_aixs_solar_tracker
solar tracking system with the help of  Arduino uno. ðŸ”¥

Traditionally, solar panels are fixed and the movement of sun over the horizon means that the solar panel does not harness maximum energy most of the time. In order to maximize the power from the solar panel, the panel should face the sun all time. In this project, we will make a sun tracking system which will help the solar panels to generate maximum power.
